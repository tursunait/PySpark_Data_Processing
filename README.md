# Customer Satisfaction Analysis (Feedback) - PySpark Data Processing

## Project Overview
This project leverages PySpark to analyze and visualize customer feedback data, with a focus on satisfaction scores across different countries and loyalty levels. The analysis aims to derive insights into factors influencing customer satisfaction, using a combination of Spark SQL queries and PySpark DataFrame transformations. The project also includes CI/CD integration for testing, formatting, and deployment.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load and process a large dataset of customer feedback.
- **Spark SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries on PySpark DataFrames to derive insights.
- **Data Transformations**: Apply transformations to compute and analyze various metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations for correlation and distribution of satisfaction scores.
- **Logging**: Log outputs and visualizations to markdown for comprehensive reporting.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer feedback with fields like:
- `CustomerID`
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Country`
- `Income`
- `ProductQuality`
- `ServiceQuality`
- `PurchaseFrequency`
- `FeedbackScore`
- `LoyaltyLevel`
- `SatisfactionScore`

This data allows for a multi-faceted analysis of customer satisfaction metrics across demographics and feedback variables.

## Analysis
### 1. Average Satisfaction by Country
Using Spark SQL, we calculate the average `SatisfactionScore` grouped by `Country`, allowing us to compare customer satisfaction levels across different regions. This provides insights into how satisfaction varies internationally and can help identify areas with higher or lower satisfaction.

### 2. Correlation Matrix of Key Variables
A correlation matrix is plotted for numerical columns such as `Income`, `ProductQuality`, `ServiceQuality`, `PurchaseFrequency`, and `SatisfactionScore`. This helps uncover relationships among these variables, giving insights into which factors might influence customer satisfaction the most.

### 3. Distribution of Satisfaction Scores
We plot a histogram to visualize the distribution of `SatisfactionScore` across all records, highlighting the overall customer satisfaction trend. This distribution reveals patterns and anomalies in customer satisfaction, which can further guide targeted improvements.
